## Install

```bash
pip install brain-mcp
brain-mcp init --full
brain-mcp setup claude
```

Restart Claude. Done. **25 tools available.**

## What You Can Do

| Ask your AI | What happens |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Search my conversations about auth" | Finds 23 conversations across 8 months, with quotes |
| "What do I think about microservices?" | Synthesizes your views from 31 past conversations |
| "Where did I leave off with the DB redesign?" | Reconstructs your context — open questions, last decisions, 12ms |
| "How has my thinking about testing evolved?" | Tracks your opinion trajectory over time |
| "Should I switch to a monorepo?" | Checks alignment with your stated principles |
| "What would it cost to switch focus right now?" | Quantifies switching cost — open threads you'd abandon |

---

## The Problem Nobody Talks About

You're mid-sprint on an auth system. You get pulled into a meeting about the data pipeline. Two hours later, you can't remember what you were doing. Not just "where was I in the code" — you've lost the *entire mental model*. The decisions you'd already made. The approach you'd chosen. The three things you'd decided *not* to do and why.

Most memory tools store *facts*. brain-mcp reconstructs *cognitive state* — where you were in a problem, what you'd decided, what questions were still open, and what it would cost to switch away.

### Without vs. With

**Without:**

> *"I was working on something with embeddings last month... let me check my chat history... which conversation was it..."*
>
> **30 minutes later:** Maybe 60% recovered.

**With:**

```
> tunnel_state("ai-dev")

🧠 ai-dev — executing stage
Open questions: 38 | Decisions made: 33

❓ Top open:
  - What are the results of the 3-model A/B test?
  - How does the improved prompt v6 perform?

✅ Recent decisions:
  - Run the 3-model A/B test using prompt v6
  - Upgrade to GPT-4o structured output

⏱️ 12ms
```

12 milliseconds to reconstruct the mental state that took weeks to build. That's real data, not a mockup.

All data stays on your machine. Embedding model runs locally (nomic-v1.5 on Apple Silicon). **No cloud. No API costs for core operations.**

## 25 Tools

### 🧠 Cognitive Prosthetic (8)

The tools that make this different from every other memory system.

| Tool | What it does | Speed |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `tunnel_state` | "Load your save game" — reconstructs where you were in any domain | 12ms |
| `context_recovery` | Full re-entry brief with summaries, open questions, decisions | 12ms |
| `switching_cost` | Quantified cost of switching between domains | 9ms |
| `open_threads` | Everything unfinished, everywhere | 2.7s |
| `dormant_contexts` | Abandoned domains with open questions you forgot about | 2.7s |
| `cognitive_patterns` | When and how you think best, with data | 10ms |
| `tunnel_history` | Engagement timeline for a domain | 5ms |
| `trust_dashboard` | System-wide proof the safety net works | 59ms |

### 🔍 Search (6)

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `semantic_search` | Vector search via LanceDB (768d nomic embeddings) |
| `search_conversations` | Keyword search across all conversations |
| `unified_search` | Search conversations + GitHub + markdown at once |
| `search_summaries` | Structured summaries (extract: decisions/questions/quotes) |
| `search_docs` | Markdown corpus search |
| `unfinished_threads` | Threads with open questions by domain |

### 🔬 Synthesis (4)
